# Riot API Fun Tool

## Description

I wrote this tool for fun to pull down metadata from the Riot API regarding some of my InfoSec colleagues to troll them about their experiences playing [LoL](https://www.leagueoflegends.com) before posting that information in a *very friendly* format to a [Slack](https://www.slack.com) channel.

## SetUp & Requirements

- **Python 2.7**
- **Non-Standard Modules**
  - Slackclient
  - Docopt
- **Required Accounts**
  - [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com)
  - [Slack](https://www.slack.com)
- **Auth Requirements**
  - [Riot API Key](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/api-keys)
  - [Slack Web Token](https://api.slack.com/web) and click on `Generate Test Tokens` towards the bottom of the page.
- **Usage**
  - Run ```python level_check.py```
  - Fully documented in the tool as per ```python level_check.py -h```

## Fun

- This is only some fun, purely trolling on pure performance in LoL ;-)
- Statistical analysis on performance is purely illogical and designed to tilt!
